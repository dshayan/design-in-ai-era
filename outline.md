# The Evolution of Design in the AI Era
## Presentation Outline

### 1. Opening: The Historical Context - "Bridges to the Future"

**The Pattern of Technological Disruption**
- Computing paradigms don't exist in isolation - each builds bridges to the next
- Historical progression: Mainframes → PCs → Mobile → Wearables (Thompson, "The Gen AI Bridge to the Future")
- Key insight: "The application layer on one paradigm provides the bridge to the next one"

**The Bridge Mechanism**
- Applications bridged mainframes to PCs (interactive vs. batch processing)
- The Internet bridged PCs to smartphones (connectivity and communication)
- **Today: Generative AI is building the bridge to wearables** (natural language interfaces)

**Why This Matters for Design**
- Each transition required fundamental rethinking of interfaces
- We're not just adding AI features - we're in a paradigm shift
- The future isn't about better apps, it's about entirely new interaction models

### 2. Current State: Where We Are Now

**The Designer Reality Check**
- 89% of designers say AI has improved their workflow (State of AI in Design Report 2025)
- But tool fatigue is real - "bouncing between standalone apps and disjointed workflows"
- Exploration phase adoption: 84% vs. Creation: 68% vs. Delivery: 39%

**The Web is Transforming**
- Microsoft's vision: MCP (Model Context Protocol) + NLWeb (natural language web interface)
- Moving from human web to agentic web (Thompson, "The Agentic Web and Original Sin")
- Challenge: "What's going to make that worth it?" for content creators

**The Self-Teaching Reality**
- 96% of designers learned AI through self-teaching, not formal training
- Startups lead adoption - 2x more likely to fully adopt vs. large organizations
- We're all figuring this out together

### 3. The Interface Debate: Chat as the New Paradigm?

**The Case FOR Chat Interfaces**
Kevin Weil (OpenAI CPO): "Chat is an amazing interface because it's so versatile"
- Universal communication method spanning all intelligence levels
- "It's the way we talk" - unstructured, maximum bandwidth communication
- "The magic of LLMs" - first time we have models that understand complexity of human speech

**The Case AGAINST Chat-Only Thinking**
Julie Zhuo identifies five critical problems:
1. **Blank page problem** - "puts the burden on the user to learn what to use it for"
2. **Iteration problem** - "forcing a potential content consumer to continually decide"
3. **Input-output mismatch** - "typing and tapping sucks"
4. **Scoping problem** - AI "doesn't know what it doesn't know"
5. **Personalization opportunity** - "translate the message to best connect with my brain"

**The Nuanced Reality**
- Chat as baseline + specialized interfaces for specific tasks
- Weil: "You still want chat as this baseline for anything that falls out of whatever vertical you happen to be building for"

### 4. Transformation of the Design Process

**The New Design Workflow**
Aparna Chennapragada (Microsoft CPO): "If you're not prototyping and building to see what you want to build, I think you're doing it wrong"

**The Vibe Coding Revolution**
- Kevin Weil: "Why shouldn't we be vibe coding demos right, left and center? Instead of showing stuff in Figma, we should be showing prototypes"
- Example: Microsoft's CPO built an internal tool by vibe coding
- "Demos before memos" - faster path from idea to experience

**The Steve Jobs Principle (1997)**
From OpenStep Interface Builder demo:
- "The line of code that a developer can write the fastest, maintain the cheapest, and never breaks for the user is a line of code the developer never had to write"
- **Goal: "Eliminate 80% of the code... let them focus on just the 20% that's unique"**
- This principle now applies to design work too

**The New Team Structure**
- Weil: "You're definitely going to live in a world where you have researchers built into every product team"
- Fine-tuned models will be everywhere
- Design teams will need "quasi researcher machine learning engineer types"

### 5. Closing: What Remains Constant

**Timeless Design Principles Still Apply**
Despite all the change, core UX principles remain:

**Feedback & Transparency**
- Example from Weil: When AI needs 20 seconds to think, "I wouldn't just go mute... I might go like, 'That's a good question. All right.'"
- Nielsen's visibility principle: Keep users informed about system status

**Human-Centered Reasoning**
- Weil's counterintuitive insight: "You can often reason about it the way you would reason about another human and it works"
- Design AI experiences by thinking about human behavior patterns

**The Ceiling is Still Human**
- State of AI Report: "AI is great for getting started, but not always for crossing the finish line"
- "That last 40%—the nuance, quality, and polish—still belongs to human hands"

**The Fundamental Truth**
- Technology changes, human needs don't
- Good design is still about understanding users, solving real problems, and creating meaningful experiences
- AI is a powerful new tool, but design thinking remains our north star

## Key Takeaways for Divar Teams

1. **Embrace the Bridge Moment** - We're not just adding AI features, we're preparing for the next computing paradigm
2. **Prototype Early and Often** - The fastest way to understand AI's potential is to build with it
3. **Invest in Learning** - 96% are self-teaching; create internal knowledge sharing
4. **Design for Humans** - AI experiences should feel natural and transparent
5. **Focus on the 20%** - Let AI handle the common work, focus on what makes your product unique

*"The AI models that you're using today is the worst AI model you will ever use for the rest of your life"* - Kevin Weil

The future is being built now. The question isn't whether to adapt, but how quickly we can learn and evolve.
