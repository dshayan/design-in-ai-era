# Commit Message Generation

This rule instructs the AI to generate a concise, single-line commit message at the end of its output whenever code changes are made.

## Format

After completing any code modifications, the AI should conclude its response with a single line in this format:

```
Commit Message: [action] [component]; [action] [component]; ...
```

## Guidelines

- Use present tense verbs (Add, Update, Fix, Refactor, Remove, etc.)
- Be specific but concise about what was changed
- Separate multiple changes with semicolons
- Focus on the functional impact of changes
- No need for a commit message if only answering questions without code changes

## Examples

```
Commit Message: Add user authentication service; Update README with setup instructions
```

```
Commit Message: Fix database connection timeout; Remove deprecated API endpoints
```

```
Commit Message: Refactor error handling in payment processor; Add unit tests
```
